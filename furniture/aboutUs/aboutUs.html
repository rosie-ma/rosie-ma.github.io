    <h1>DESIGN</h1>
      <p>
        The first design ideas are developed through hand sketches, mood boards, 3D renderings, colour sketches and watercolours.<br />
        A design consultation is an opportunity to explore how you can turn your ideas into a reality. Whatever you want for your home, our skilled design consultants have the knowledge to make it happen, creating a solution that’s perfect for you and your lifestyle. The consultation is time to think big, explore the possibilities and define exactly what you want, in the comfort of your own home.
        We can work with photographs, technical drawings and renderings of your intended space; however, most of our clients prefer a personal visit from one of our designers, so we can really get a feel for your vision.<br />
        Fabrics, materials, budgets and technology will be discussed at this stage. <br />
        The initial design phase culminates in a presentation of full colour drawings or 3D renderings, along with wood, fabric, leathers or finishes samples.

    <h1>CRAFTING</h1>
    <p>
        When you are completely happy with the final design, the piece will be put into production with some of the finest artisans in England. Our clients are invited to experience a workshop visit to see their design coming to life during the crafting phase.<br />
        We will closely work with any third parties involved with the project, such as interior designers, architects, builders or specialist consultants to ensure a smooth transition from the initial design through to delivery and installation.<br />
        We will oversee delivery to your space and installation, ensuring that your new furniture is correctly and safely situated.<br />

    <h1>COMMISSIONING</h1>
    <p>
        When you are happy with the initial designs and are ready to proceed, we will officially commission the project. Once commissioned we then provide full, detailed technical CAD drawings to be signed off and confirmed. We can also produce full size templates where required.

            <p class="name"> What is Lorem Ipsum?</p>
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
